My Intro to Github
I am an Astrophysicist mainly studying the Sun. I love to code and have a keen interest in the rapidly developing field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence etc!
I work at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo. This is an exciting place and is pretty unique because here we combine amazing observations with the state-of-the-art simulations to understand the Sun. The place is simply amazing!
